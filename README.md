## Introduction

The DNS Private Zone feature within OCI's DNS service allows the users to expand the capabilities of the built-in VCN DNS resolver, enabling them to use custom domain names for the resources within the VCNs.

This sample deployment uses OCI Events to monitor a parent compartment for compute resource creation and termination. When such an event occurs, OCI Functions are triggered to maintain the records in a user-configured DNS Zone. 

In case of duplicate records, the function will attempt to generate a new hostname using the latest five characters in instance OCID.

Two free-form tags: `hostnames` and `dns_zone_record_hashes`, will be attached to the instance to confirm the DNS Zone record insertion at instance creation and DNS Zone record deletion at instance termination.

## Prerequisite

- Administrative rights (to manage OCIRs, Functions, IAM, Compute, DNS Zones, Stacks) in the tenancy.
- The DNS zone should be created before this deployment.
- The subnet used for functions must provide connectivity to OCI API via a Service Gateway or NAT Gateway.

## Getting Started

Navigate to User Profile in OCI Console and create a new [auth token](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcredentials.htm#create_swift_password). Auth token is used during deployment to push the functions container images to OCIR.

## Automated deployment

Click below button, fill-in required values and `Apply`.

## Manual deployment

 **Prerequisites:** `bash`, `terraform`, `fn`, `docker`

1. Create a file named `terraform.auto.tfvars` in the root directory using below list of variables and update associated values based on your use-case:
```
tenancy_ocid            = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1...7dq"
user_ocid               = "ocid1.user.oc1...7wa"
private_key_path        = "/path/to/..../oci_api_key.pem"
private_key_password    = ""
fingerprint             = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:00:11:22:33:44:55:66:77:88:99"
region                  = "eu-frankfurt-1"

deployment_compartment  = "ocid1.compartment.oc1...iqq"
monitored_compartment   = "ocid1.compartment.oc1...iqq"
application_subnet      = "ocid1.subnet.oc1...uca"

oci_username            = "oracleidentitycloudservice/alice@oracle.com"
oci_auth_token          = "<generated_auth_token>"
dns_zone_ocid           = "ocid1.dns-zone.oc1...a4q"

```
2. Execute `terraform init`
3. Execute `terraform plan`
4. Execute `terraform apply`

## Customization

The function code is written in Python and can be customized by modifying `func.py` file in the two archives under `utils` directory. After code change, pack the code in a container image, push the new container image to OCIR and update the function container image.

## Manual Test
  - Create an instance, confirm if a DNS A record is added to the DNS zone and the two free-form tags (`hostnames` and `dns_zone_record_hashes`) are present on the instance.
  - Terminate the instance and confirm if the DNS record was removed.

## Notes/Issues
* Use OCI Functions logging to troubleshoot any issue with function execution.
